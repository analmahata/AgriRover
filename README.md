## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.12.7** installed on your system.
2. Required hardware components connected and set up according to the design.

### Setting Up the Python Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment with your system‚Äôs default Python version, run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

> **Note**: If you have multiple versions of Python installed (e.g., 3.13, 3.12, 3.11, 3.9), use the following steps to specify the Python version when creating the virtual environment..

```bash
py -0  # Show available Python versions
```

To create a virtual environment using a specific Python version, run:

```bash
py -3.13 -m venv venv   # For Python 3.13
py -3.12 -m venv venv   # For Python 3.12
py -3.11 -m venv venv   # For Python 3.11
py -3.9 -m venv venv    # For Python 3.9
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

- **Linux/macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- **Windows**

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> **Note**: Use `Python 3.12.7` for stable package support.

- Download and install [Python 3.12.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3127/)

## Project Usage

- **Hardware Setup**: Connect all the hardware components according to the wiring diagram.
- **Software Setup**: Install the necessary Python packages and dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Run the Project**: Start the Python script to initiate the AgriRover's operations.
